# About Studio Poetics

Studio Poetics is a sense-making design practice. We explore the beauty in everyday objects and experiences through thoughtful design inspired by Kenya Hara's concepts of "White" and "Exformation."

Our approach combines rigorous research with intuitive exploration, resulting in designs that reveal the hidden poetry in ordinary things.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that design should not just solve problems but also create meaningful experiences. By focusing on the subtle qualities of materials, space, and interaction, we aim to create work that resonates on both intellectual and emotional levels.

## Our Team

Our multidisciplinary team brings together expertise in product design, digital experiences, material research, and strategic thinking. This diversity of perspectives allows us to approach each project with fresh eyes and innovative solutions.

# Building Technology with Empathy

In an age where technology increasingly mediates our daily experiences, the concept of empathy in design has never been more important. Kenya Hara's notion of 'Exformation' - the deliberate emptying out of information to create space for imagination - offers a powerful framework for creating more humane technology.

## The Problem with Information Overload

Modern interfaces often bombard users with options, notifications, and features. This approach assumes that more information leads to better experiences, but the opposite is often true. When faced with too much information, users experience cognitive overload, leading to stress and disengagement.

## Exformation as a Design Principle

Exformation suggests that by carefully removing unnecessary elements, we create space for the user's imagination and intuition. This approach respects the user's intelligence and creates experiences that feel more natural and less intrusive.

## Practical Applications

Here are some ways we can apply exformation to technology design:

1. **Thoughtful Defaults**: Design systems that make good assumptions about what users need, reducing the burden of constant decision-making.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal features and information only when they become relevant to the user's current task.

3. **Sensory Feedback**: Use subtle visual, auditory, or haptic feedback to communicate with users without demanding their full attention.

4. **Negative Space**: Embrace emptiness in interfaces to create rhythm and focus.

By incorporating these principles, we can create technology that feels less like a demanding presence and more like a thoughtful companion.
